# Face Recognition
Implementing image processing techniques for facial detection

## Summary

Face Recognition is a Python project that implements a facial recognition using image processing techniques. The project includes three main steps: background subtraction, removing noise, and edge detecttion. These techniques are commonly used in computer vision applications.

## Features

- **Facial Detection:** Utilizes background subtraction to isolate facial features from the background in an image.
- **Median Filter:** Enhance facial features and reduce noise.
- **Canny Mask:** Implements a Canny mask for edge detection to further refine facial boundaries.


## Tested Images
Sample images for testing and validation are included in separate folders within the project directory.\
Here are some example images:
